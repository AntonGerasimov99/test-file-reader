#Overloading vs Overriding Confusion
Text for chapter Overloading vs Overriding Confusion
##Another common issue is confusing method overloading with method overriding, both of which are forms of polymorphism.
Remember, method overloading occurs when two methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.
###EXAMPLE
#Improper Use of Abstraction
##Abstraction is a powerful tool for hiding complexity, but it can also lead to incomplete or incorrect implementation if not properly used.
Always provide complete implementation of abstract methods in the subclasses.
###EXAMPLE
#Encapsulation Overlooked
##Lastly, forgetting to encapsulate your classes’ data can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse.
Always use private visibility for your data members and provide public getter and setter methods.
By being aware of these common issues and how to solve them, you can more effectively use Java’s OOP concepts to structure and organize your code.

#The Theory Behind Java OOP Concepts
##Before diving into the practical application of Java’s OOP concepts, let’s first understand the theory behind it.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses ‘objects’ – instances of classes – to design applications and computer programs.
It’s based on several core concepts: namely, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
###EXAMPLE
#Classes and Objects
##In Java, a class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
A class defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that an object can have.
Here’s a simple example of a class and an object in Java:
